Puts Prerender and Prefetch tag in the page. Allowing compatible navigators to do a pre-load of the page you figure the visitor is going to go.

== Description ==

Â¿What is Prerender and Prefetch? Nice question. It's a new-navigators technique (ok i'm a liar, Mozilla do it from 2003!) that loads in background the next page you believe the visitor is going to visit.

This plugin puts the required metatag in your WordPress pages, based on settings you can change, allowing those compatible navigators to do a pre-load of the next page. When the visitor try to visit that page Boom! it just appears without need to wait for it!

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to your plugins directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Configure the server's maximum load (because of pre-load can increase the server's load, you have to configure a limit where Prerender and Prefetch will be off)
4. Enjoy! Go fast!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

They are techniques to do a preload in background of another page, the logical use to this is load the page is going most-probably to be the next page the visitor is going to go. So the visitor don't have to wait for the load of that page, it was already loaded i background and just shows up!.
